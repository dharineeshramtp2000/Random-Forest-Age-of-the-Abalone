# Random-Forest-Age-of-the-Abalone
The random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that randomly creates and merges multiple decision trees into one “forest.” The goal is not to rely on a single learning model, but rather a collection of decision models to improve accuracy. The primary difference between this approach and the standard decision tree algorithms is that the root nodes feature splitting nodes are generated randomly.

Here we try to predict the Age of Abalone based on its physical parameters
