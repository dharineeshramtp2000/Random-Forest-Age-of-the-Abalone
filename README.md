# Random-Forest-Age-of-the-Abalone
The random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that randomly creates and merges multiple decision trees into one “forest.” The goal is not to rely on a single learning model, but rather a collection of decision models to improve accuracy. The primary difference between this approach and the standard decision tree algorithms is that the root nodes feature splitting nodes are generated randomly.
